My Personal Portfolio & Resume Website ‚ú®
Hey there! Welcome to the repository for my personal corner of the internet. This isn't just a resume; it's a living, breathing showcase of my journey, my skills, and the things I'm passionate about building. I poured a lot of thought and code into this to create something that truly represents me, and I'm excited to share it with you.

üöÄ What's This All About?
This project is my digital resume, brought to life. The goal was to go beyond a static PDF and create an interactive experience that tells a story. It details my professional experiences, showcases my projects, and gives you a sense of who I am as a developer and a person.

I believe that a website should look and feel great no matter where you're viewing it. That's why I put a huge emphasis on making this site fully responsive and adaptive. Whether you're on a giant desktop monitor, a tablet, or your phone, the experience should be seamless and beautiful.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Tools
This website was built from the ground up using a classic, powerful trio, enhanced with some fantastic modern libraries to add a little magic.

HTML5: The backbone of the site, structured with semantic and accessible markup.

CSS3: For all the styling, from layout and colors to the fluid animations. I used modern techniques like Flexbox and Grid to create the responsive layouts.

JavaScript (ES6+): This is where the magic happens! I used vanilla JavaScript to handle all the interactive elements, dynamic content, and user events.

JavaScript Libraries I Fell in Love With:
I also integrated a couple of my favorite JavaScript libraries to add some extra flair and smoothness to the user experience:

AOS (Animate On Scroll): To create those subtle, beautiful fade-in and slide-in animations as you scroll down the page. It really helps to guide the user's eye and make the experience more engaging.

‚ú® Features & Highlights
Fully Responsive Design: From a 4K monitor down to the smallest smartphone, the layout adapts perfectly.

Interactive Timeline: My work experience and education are presented in an easy-to-follow, interactive timeline.

Smooth Scrolling & Animations: Subtle animations and transitions make for a polished and professional feel.

Project Showcase: A dedicated section to display my work with links to live demos and source code.

‚úçÔ∏è My Design Philosophy
I wanted a clean, modern, and minimalist design that puts the content first. The color palette was chosen to be professional yet approachable. The typography is clean and readable. My goal was to create a user experience that is not just functional, but delightful. Every animation, every transition, and every layout choice was made with intention.
